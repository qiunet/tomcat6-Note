package org.apache.catalina;

/**
 * An <b>Engine</b> is a Container that represents the entire Catalina servlet
 * engine.  It is useful in the following types of scenarios:
 * 
 * 一个Engine(引擎) 是一个充当所有servlet引擎的 Container. (注: 一个service 仅有一个engine). 它常用于下列情况:
 * <ul>
 * <li>You wish to use Interceptors that see every single request processed
 *     by the entire engine.
 * <li>You wish to run Catalina in with a standalone HTTP connector, but still
 *     want support for multiple virtual hosts.
 * </ul>
 * 
 *  . 你想使用拦截器查看每个单独请求处理.
 *  . 你想在一个独立的http connector 运行Catalina. 还希望能支持多个虚拟主机.
 * 
 * In general, you would not use an Engine when deploying Catalina connected
 * to a web server (such as Apache), because the Connector will have
 * utilized the web server's facilities to determine which Context (or
 * perhaps even which Wrapper) should be utilized to process this request.
 * 
 *  
 * <p>
 * The child containers attached to an Engine are generally implementations
 * of Host (representing a virtual host) or Context (representing individual
 * an individual servlet context), depending upon the Engine implementation.
 * <p>
 * If used, an Engine is always the top level Container in a Catalina
 * hierarchy. Therefore, the implementation's <code>setParent()</code> method
 * should throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
